## What do you do ?
The game is quit simple, some letter will appear in the terminal and you will have to guess the 3 words in the mix of letter. You have 3 difficulty : Easy, medium and hard and you also have 3 round in game. You have the possibility to skip a round by sending "skip" to the terminal. Have fun !










This is a little game I did to train myself in python. I will update it occasionally
